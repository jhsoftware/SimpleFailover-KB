# Licensing FAQ

## Which license type do I need?

Please see [Compare license types](https://simplefailover.com/compare).

## How many licenses do I need?

One license (of any type) is required for each computer running Simple Failover.

## What versions/releases are a license is valid for?

1) The current version at the time of purchase (new or upgrade).
2) Any versions (major/minor\*) released within one year after the purchase (see "one year free upgrade protection" below).
3) Any patch (build number\* increase only) released at any time (also beyond the one year), for above versions (see 1 and 2).

Exception: Licenses purchased between April 1st 2013 and October 31st 2015 (v. 1.x / 2.0) are also valid with v. 2.1.

\* We use this software version numbering structure:
`<major>.<minor>.<build>`

## Do licenses expire?

No, our licenses are perpetual. A license is valid **forever** for the versions/releases mentioned above.

## Do I have to pay a yearly "maintenance fee"?

No, our licenses are perpetual. They are **not subscriptions**, and there are no recurring fees. 

You only pay again if you choose to upgrade to a new version released a year or more after your purchase.

## "One year free upgrade protection"?

With any license purchase (new or upgrade), you receive one year of free upgrade protection.

This entitles you to receive any new version of the software for free, regardless of major or minor update, within a year of the purchase.

## Do licenses need to be "activated"?

Yes, license activation is required (briefly requires an Internet connection).

For more on activation, please see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_activation>

## Do you offer free/discounted licenses for educational, non-profits, or other types of organizations?

Sorry, no.
